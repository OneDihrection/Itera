# Design system

This folder owns reusable UI controls and styling for Itera. Follow the repository [agent instructions](../../AGENTS.md) and [system design](../../SYSTEM_DESIGN.md).

Every agent doing UI work must inspect `Itera/DesignSystem` and read its README first. Use existing reusable controls and styling from that folder. If no suitable component exists, create a reusable one there before using it. Extend compatible components instead of duplicating controls or styling in feature folders.

Screens may use native SwiftUI layout directly; navigation must use the shared router. Feature views own screen composition; therapy-specific compositions may remain in their feature, using design system controls and styling. Add components only as needed; do not build a speculative library or wrap every SwiftUI primitive.

Design system components accept values, bindings, content, and actions as needed. They must not depend on feature view models, repositories, or exercise logic.

The folder starts with documentation only. Add Swift components when a real UI need arises; the existing recursive source entry in project.yml includes them automatically.

## Navigation, typography, and code conventions

All agents must use the shared NavigationRouter for app navigation and sheet/full-screen presentation. Do not create feature-owned NavigationStacks, destination registrations, modal state, or direct dismissal bypasses. Native SwiftUI layout remains allowed.

Use .typography(...) or inherit the root body style for app-authored text. Font names and direct font styling belong only in DesignSystem/Typography.

Keep body focused on composition. Prefer named private computed view properties, using @ViewBuilder for conditional or multiple-view sections, or dedicated subviews for meaningful sections with inputs, bindings, state, reuse, or substantial complexity. Reusable controls belong in DesignSystem; avoid splitting trivial expressions mechanically.

Every newly authored file must have a format-appropriate header with its filename, actual author, and creation date. Use an explicitly supplied author first, otherwise effective git config user.name; ask if neither exists. Never hard-code a team member or use the AI's name. Preserve existing creation authorship. Swift uses Xcode-style // Created by headers; YAML uses comments and Markdown uses HTML comments. Preserve copied binaries and third-party licenses unchanged and document their source separately; never corrupt formats without comment support.

Prefer generous spacing and readable multiline declarations, calls, expressions, and conditions. Use /// Markdown API documentation when helpful and // MARK: - sections in longer files. Comment non-obvious purpose, constraints, and lifecycle behavior rather than restating syntax.
